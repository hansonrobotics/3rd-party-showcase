# VeriLook Surveillance #

Neurotechnology's VeriLook Surveillance SDK is designed for developing software that performs biometric face identification and detects moving pedestrians or objects using live video streams from high-resolution digital surveillance cameras. The SDK is used for passive identification – when passers-by do not make any efforts to be recognized. List of possible uses includes law enforcement, security, attendance control, visitor counting, traffic monitoring and other commercial applications.
